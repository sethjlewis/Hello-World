# Hello-World
Ideas, tips and pointers
I'm an elctrician that is tired of getting laid off. 
I want more freedom in my life, to create and build more useful things with a group of talented and fun individuals
I will still work as an electrician, but at some point, probably a year or so from today, I'll be a developer of some kind
I've always been fascinated by software development, the web, and coding. 
I love to learn, so I'm up for the challenge
